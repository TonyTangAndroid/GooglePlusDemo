    <string name="be_honest">BE HONEST AND TRUE\n\n\n\n
          BY GEORGE BIRDSEYE\n\n\n\n
Be honest and true, boys!\n\n
Whatever you do, boys,\n\n
Let this be your motto through life.\n\n
Both now and forever,\n\n
Be this your endeavor,\n\n
When wrong with the right is at strife.\n\n
The best and the truest,\n\n
Alas! are the fewest;\n\n
But be one of these if you can.\n\n
In duty ne’er fail; you\n\n
Will find ’twill avail you,\n\n
And bring its reward when a man.\n\n
Don’t think life plain sailing;\n\n
There’s danger of failing,\n\n
Though bright seem the future to be;\n\n
But honor and labor,\n\n
And truth to your neighbor,\n\n
Will bear you safe over life’s sea.\n\n
Then up and be doing,\n\n
Right only pursuing,\n\n
And take your fair part in the strife.\n\n
Be honest and true, boys,\n\n
Whatever you do, boys,\n\n
Let this be your motto through life!\n\n</string>

        by The Alan Parsons Project\n\n\n\n
        As far as my eyes can see\n\n
There are Shadows approaching me\n\n
And to those I left behind\n\n
I wanted you to Know\n\n
You\'ve always shared my deepest thoughts\n\n
You follow where I go\n\n
And oh when I\'m old and wise\n\n
Bitter words mean little to me\n\n
Autumn Winds will blow right through me\n\n
And someday in the mist of time\n\n
When they asked me if I knew you\n\n
I\'d smile and say you were a friend of mine\n\n
And the sadness would be Lifted from my eyes\n\n
Oh when I\'m old and wise\n\n
As far as my Eyes can see\n\n
There are shadows surrounding me\n\n
And to those I leave behind\n\n
I want you all to know\n\n
You\'ve always Shared my darkest hours\n\n
I\'ll miss you when I go\n\n
And oh, when I\'m old and wise\n\n
Heavy words that tossed and blew me\n\n
Like Autumn winds that will blow right through me\n\n
And someday in the mist of time\n\n
When they ask you if you knew me\n\n
Remember that You were a friend of mine\n\n
As the final curtain falls before my eyes\n\n
Oh when I\'m Old and wise\n\n
As far as my eyes can see\n\n</string>


  <string name="life_is_a_very_funny_proposition_after_all">Life\'s a very funny proposition after all\n\n
        by George M. Cohen\n\n\n\n
        Did you ever sit and ponder\n\n
    Sit and wonder, sit and think\n\n
    Why we\'re here and what this life is all about?\n\n
    It\'s a problem that has driven\n\n
    Many brainy men to drink\n\n
    It\'s the weirdest thing they\'ve tried to figure out\n\n
    About a thousand different theories\n\n
    All the scientists can show\n\n
    But never yet have proved a reason why\n\n
    With all we\'ve thought\n\n
    And all we\'re taught\n\n
    Why all we seem to know\n\n
    Is we\'re born and live a while and then we die\n\n\n\n

    Life\'s a very funny proposition after all\n\n
    Imagination, jealousy, hypocrisy and all\n\n
    Three meals a day, a whole lot to say\n\n
    When you haven\'t got the coin you\'re always in the way\n\n
    Everybody\'s fighting as we wend our way along\n\n
    Every fellow claims the other fellow\'s in the wrong\n\n
    Hurried and worried until we\'re buried and there\'s no curtain call\n\n
    Life\'s a very funny proposition after all\n\n\n\n

    When all things are coming easy, and when luck is with a man\n\n
    Why then life to him is sunshine everywhere\n\n
    Then the fates blow rather breezy and they quite upset a plan\n\n
    Then he\'ll cry that life\'s a burden hard to bear\n\n
    Though today may be a day of smiles, tomorrow\'s still in doubt\n\n
    And what brings me joy, may bring you care and woe\n\n
    We\'re born to die, but don\'t know why, or what it\'s all about\n\n
    And the more we try to learn the less we know\n\n\n\n

    Life\'s a very funny proposition, you can bet\n\n
    And no one\'s ever solved the problem properly as yet\n\n
    Young for a day, then old and gray\n\n
    Like the rose that buds and blooms and fades and falls away\n\n
    Losing health to gain our wealth as through this dream we tour\n\n
    Everything\'s a guess and nothing\'s absolutely sure\n\n
    Battles exciting and fates we\'re fighting until the curtain falls\n\n
    Life\'s a very funny proposition after all\n\n</string>

  <string name="do_not_stop_believing">Don\'t Stop Believing\n\n
        by Journey\n\n\n\n
        Just a small town girl\n\n\n\n
Livin\' in a lonely world\n\n
She took the midnight train\n\n
Goin\' anywhere\n\n
Just a city boy\n\n
Born and raised in South Detroit\n\n
He took the midnight train\n\n
Goin\' anywhere\n\n\n\n

A singer in a smokey room\n\n
The smell of wine and cheap perfume\n\n
For a smile they can share the night\n\n
It goes on and on and on and on\n\n\n\n

Strangers waiting\n\n
Up and down the boulevard\n\n
Their shadows searching\n\n
In the night\n\n
Streetlight people\n\n
Livin\' just to find emotion\n\n
Hidin\' somewhere in the night\n\n\n\n

Workin\' hard to get my fill\n\n
Everybody wants a thrill\n\n
Payin\' anything to roll the dice\n\n
Just one more time\n\n
Some will win\n\n
Some will lose\n\n
Some were born to sing the blues\n\n
Oh, the movie never ends\n\n
It goes on and on and on and on\n\n\n\n

Strangers waiting\n\n
Up and down the boulevard\n\n
Their shadows searching\n\n
In the night\n\n
Streetlight people\n\n
Livin\' just to find emotion\n\n
Hidin\' somewhere in the night\n\n\n\n

[Instrumental interlude]

Don\'t stop believin\'\n\n
Hold on to that feelin\'\n\n
Streetlight people\n\n
Don\'t stop believin\'\n\n
Hold on\n\n
Streetlight people\n\n
Don\'t stop believin\'\n\n
Hold on to that feelin\'\n\n
Streetlight people\n\n
Don\'t stop believin\'\n\n
Hold on to that feelin\'\n\n
Streetlight people\n\n
Don\'t stop believin\'\n\n
Streetlight people\n\n
Don\'t stop</string>
